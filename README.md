# AWS SageMaker Canvas Prediction Model
# Overview
This repository contains a supervised learning model developed using AWS SageMaker Canvas, a no-code environment for building machine learning models. The model is designed for regression tasks, aiming to predict continuous numerical values based on input features.

# Features
No-Code Development: Utilizes AWS SageMaker Canvas for building machine learning models without writing code, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment.

Supervised Learning: Implements a supervised learning approach, where the model learns from labeled data to make predictions.

Regression Task: Specifically tailored for regression tasks, the model predicts continuous numerical values.

Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset consisting of input features and corresponding target labels. The dataset is preprocessed within the AWS SageMaker Canvas environment to ensure compatibility with the model.

Model Architecture
The model architecture is constructed using a series of graphical components within AWS SageMaker Canvas. These components include data preprocessing steps, feature engineering techniques, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

# Usage
To use this model, follow these steps:

Data Preparation: Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and contains the necessary features and target labels.

AWS SageMaker Canvas: Import the dataset into AWS SageMaker Canvas and configure the model pipeline using the graphical interface.

Training: Train the model using the configured pipeline and monitor training performance.

Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model as an endpoint to make real-time predictions or integrate it into your applications.
